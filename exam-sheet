Windows
There were more windows based questions so you have to practice on windows GUI tools like mentioned below.
1) “Open Stego” for Stegnography
https://www.openstego.com/

2) “WireShark” for Pcap analysis
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

3) “ZAP” for SQLInjecion exploit
https://www.zaproxy.org/download/

4) “Veracrypt” for Disk Decryption
https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html

5) “Hash calculator” to find the hash of the file

Windows based Commands which will help you to find the answers.
1) net user — For Domain Users Enumeration
2) snow.exe -C -p “password” stegfile.txt
3) type C:\path.txt — It displays the content of the path.txt file.

The Username and Password file will be present in the parrot machine it will help you to crack the ftp and wordpress related questions.

Don’t be nervous, you are going to pass the exam with no doubt. Patience is really needed for the exam because the parrot machine is outdated and its very slow.
